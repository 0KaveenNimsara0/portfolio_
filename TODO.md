# TODO: Fix White Screen on GitHub Pages Deployment

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update vite.config.js to set base path to '/portfolio_public/' for GitHub Pages compatibility

- [x] Run npm run build to generate production build
- [x] Deploy the dist folder contents to GitHub Pages (move dist files to repo root or use gh-pages branch)
- [x] Test the deployed site to ensure it loads correctly
